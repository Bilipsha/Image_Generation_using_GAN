## About The Project

This project is about learning a generative model from which new samples can be generated. The dataset used for this project is CIFAR-10. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.  

In this project, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are implemented:  

* Deep Convolution GAN (DCGAN)  
* Self-Attention GAN (SA-GAN)  

GANs consist of two networks â€“ a generator (G) and a discriminator (D). G produces fake samples from random noise, while D classifies whether a given image is real or fake. Both networks compete in a zero-sum game, improving each other during training.
